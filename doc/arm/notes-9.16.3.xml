          BIND crashes on startup when linked against libuv 1.36.  This issue is
          related to recvmmsg() support in libuv which was first included in
          libuv 1.35.  The problem was addressed in libuv 1.37, but the relevant
          libuv code change requires a special flag to be set during library
          initialization in order for recvmmsg() support to be enabled.  This
          BIND release sets that special flag when required, so recvmmsg()
          support is now enabled when BIND is compiled against either libuv 1.35
          or libuv 1.37+; libuv 1.36 is still not usable with BIND. [GL #1761]

          The native PKCS#11 EdDSA implementation has been updated to PKCS#11
          v3.0 and thus made operational again.  Contributed by Aaron Thompson.
