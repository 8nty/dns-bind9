          It was possible to trigger an INSIST failure when a zone with an
          interior wildcard label was queried in a certain pattern. This was
          disclosed in CVE-2020-8619. [GL #1111] [GL #1718]

          When fully updating the NSEC3 chain for a large zone via IXFR, a
          temporary loss of performance could be experienced on the secondary
          server when answering queries for nonexistent data that required
          DNSSEC proof of non-existence (in other words, queries that required
          the server to find and to return NSEC3 data). The unnecessary
          processing step that was causing this delay has now been removed.
