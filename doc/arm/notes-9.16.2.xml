	  The DNSSEC sign statistics used lots of memory.  The number of keys
	  to track is reduced to four per zone, which should be enough for
	  99% of all signed zones. [GL #1179]

	  When an RPZ policy zone was updated via zone transfer
	  and a large number of records were deleted, <command>named</command>
	  could become nonresponsive for a short period while deleted
	  names were removed from the RPZ summary database. This database
	  cleanup is now done incrementally over a longer period of time,
	  reducing such delays. [GL #1447]

	  Migration to dnssec-policy from existing DNSSEC strategy with
	  auto-dnssec maintain did not work due to bad initializing of the
	  key states.  Fixed by looking closely at the time metadata to
	  set the key states to the correct values. [GL #1706]
