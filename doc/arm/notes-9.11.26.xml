          Adjust the <command>max-recursion-queries</command> default
          from 75 to 100. Since the queries sent towards root and
          TLD servers are now included in the count (as a result
          of the fix for CVE-2020-8616),
          <command>max-recursion-queries</command> has a higher
          chance of being exceeded by non-attack queries, which is
          the main reason for increasing its default value. [GL
