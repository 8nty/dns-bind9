	  [DNS Flag Day 2020]: The default EDNS buffer size has been changed
	  from 4096 to 1232.  According to the measurements done by multiple
	  parties this should not be causing any operational problems as most of
	  the Internet "core" is able to cope with IP message sizes between
	  1400-1500 bytes, the 1232 size was picked as a conservative minimal
	  number that could be changed by the DNS operator to a estimated path
	  MTU minus the estimated header space. In practice, the smallest MTU
	  witnessed in the operational DNS community is 1500 octets, the
	  Ethernet maximum payload size, so a a useful default for maximum
	  DNS/UDP payload size on reliable networks would be 1400. [GL #2183]
