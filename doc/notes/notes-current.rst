Feature Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``ipv4only.arpa`` is now served when DNS64 is configured. [GL #385]

- It is now possible to transition a zone from secure to insecure mode
  without making it bogus in the process; changing to ``dnssec-policy
  none;`` also causes CDS and CDNSKEY DELETE records to be published, to
  signal that the entire DS RRset at the parent must be removed, as
  described in RFC 8078. [GL #1750]

- When using the ``unixtime`` or ``date`` method to update the SOA
  serial number, ``named`` and ``dnssec-signzone`` silently fell back to
  the ``increment`` method to prevent the new serial number from being
  smaller than the old serial number (using serial number arithmetics).
  ``dnssec-signzone`` now prints a warning message, and ``named`` logs a
  warning, when such a fallback happens. [GL #2058]

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- ``named`` no longer attempts to assign threads to CPUs outside the CPU
  affinity set. Thanks to Ole Bj√∏rn Hessen. [GL #2245]

- When reconfiguring ``named``, removing ``auto-dnssec`` did not turn
  off DNSSEC maintenance. This has been fixed. [GL #2341]

- Multiple threads could attempt to destroy a single RBTDB instance at
  the same time, resulting in an unpredictable but low-probability
  assertion failure in ``free_rbtdb()``. This has been fixed. [GL #2317]
