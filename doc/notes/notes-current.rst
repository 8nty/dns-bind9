Feature Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Implement ``draft-vandijk-dnsop-nsec-ttl``, NSEC(3) TTL values are now set to
  the minimum of the SOA MINIMUM value and the SOA TTL. [GL #2347].

- Reduce the supported maximum number of iterations that can be
  configured in an NSEC3 zones to 150. [GL #2642]

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- When dumping the cache to file, TTLs were being increased with
  ``max-stale-ttl``. Also the comment above stale RRsets could have nonsensical
  values if the RRset was still marked a stale but the ``max-stale-ttl`` has
  passed (and is actually an RRset awaiting cleanup). Both issues have now
  been fixed. [GL #389] [GL #2289]

- ``named`` would overwrite a zone file unconditionally when it recovered from
  a corrupted journal. [GL #2623]

- With ``dnssec-policy``, when creating new keys also check for keyid conflicts
  between the new keys too. [GL #2628]
