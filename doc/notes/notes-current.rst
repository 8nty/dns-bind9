Notes for BIND 9.17.9
---------------------

Security Fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- None.

Known Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- None.

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- None.

- A new option, ```stale-answer-client-timeout``, has been added to
  improve ``named``'s behavior with respect to serving stale data. The option
  defines the amount of time ``named`` waits before attempting
  to answer the query with a stale RRset from cache. If a stale answer
  is found, ``named`` continues the ongoing fetches, attempting to
  refresh the RRset in cache until the ``resolver-query-timeout`` interval is
  reached.

  The default value is ``1800`` (in milliseconds) and the maximum value is
  bounded to ``resolver-query-timeout`` minus one second. A value of
  ``0`` immediately returns a cached RRset if available, and still
  attempts a refresh of the data in cache.

  The option can be disabled by setting the value to ``off`` or
  ``disabled``. It also has no effect if ``stale-answer-enable`` is
  disabled.

Removed Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- None.

Feature Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``ipv4only.arpa`` is now served when ``dns64`` is configured. [GL #385]

- It is now possible to transition a zone from secure to insecure mode
  without making it bogus in the process: changing to ``dnssec-policy
  none;`` also causes CDS and CDNSKEY DELETE records to be published, to
  signal that the entire DS RRset at the parent must be removed, as
  described in RFC 8078. [GL #1750]

- The default value of ``max-stale-ttl`` has been changed from 12 hours to 1
  day and the default value of ``stale-answer-ttl`` has been changed from 1
  second to 30 seconds, following RFC 8767 recommendations. [GL #2248]

- When using the ``unixtime`` or ``date`` method to update the SOA
  serial number, ``named`` and ``dnssec-signzone`` silently fell back to
  the ``increment`` method to prevent the new serial number from being
  smaller than the old serial number (using serial number arithmetics).
  ``dnsssec-signzone`` now prints a warning message, and ``named`` logs
  a warning, when such a fallback happens. [GL #2058]

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Only assign threads to CPUs in the CPU affinity set, so that ``named`` no
  longer attempts to run threads on CPUs outside the affinity set. Thanks to
  Ole Bj√∏rn Hessen. [GL #2245]

- When reconfiguring ``named``, removing ``auto-dnssec`` did actually not turn
  off DNSSEC maintenance. This has been fixed. [GL #2341]

- Prevent rbtdb instances being destroyed by multiple threads at the same
  time. This can trigger assertion failures. [GL #2355]

- KASP incorrectly set signature validity to the value of the DNSKEY signature
  validity. This is now fixed. [GL #2383]
