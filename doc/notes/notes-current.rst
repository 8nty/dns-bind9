Notes for BIND 9.16.6
---------------------

Security Fixes

- None.

Known Issues

- None.

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- None.

Feature Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- BIND's cache database implementation has been updated to use a faster
  hash-function with better distribution.  In addition, the effective
  max-cache-size (configured explicitly, defaulting to a value based on system
  memory or set to 'unlimited') now pre-allocates fixed size hash tables. This
  prevents interruption to query resolution when the hash tables need to be
  increased in size. [GL #1775]

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- The introduction of KASP support broke whether the second field
  of sig-validity-interval was treated as days or hours. (Thanks to
  Tony Finch.) [GL !3735]
