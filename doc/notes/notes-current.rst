Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed a bug that caused the NSEC salt to be changed for KASP zones on
  every startup. :gl:`#2725`

- Signed, insecure delegation responses prepared by ``named`` either
  lacked the necessary NSEC records or contained duplicate NSEC records
  when both wildcard expansion and CNAME chaining were required to
  prepare the response. This has been fixed. :gl:`#2759`

- Queries where the wildcard match contained the letter ``W`` failed
  to return the correct response as the ``W`` was mapped to ``\000``.
  :gl:`#2779`

- Checking of ``key-directory`` and ``dnssec-policy`` was broken.
  The checks failed to account for key-directory inheritance. :gl:`#2778`
